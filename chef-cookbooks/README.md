RPCSQA Chef Cookbooks
=====================

Cookbooks used by the Rackspace Private Cloud QA team to build out our environments.

TODO:

Once the network-interfaces cookbook is fully tested and properly arranged, need to either merge with the current opscode network-interfaces or create a new opscode cookbook as an alternative to the current.

I may also make a LWRP of the network-interfaces cookbook to be merged with the chef codebase
