Jenkins Razor Scripts
===========================

These are our scripts that we run via jenkins to help manage and maintain our Razor server. 
The main ones here are nmap reboot and ping reboot to recover machines that we have lost ( i.e. reboot them so razor can install the razor micro kernel and reregister them for future use ).
